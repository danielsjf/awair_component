# Awair component for Home assistant
[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) component for the [Awair](https://getawair.com/) air quality monitor.

This project uses the Awair API which is currently still in beta. Access can be requested via the Awair [developer console](https://developer.getawair.com/console/personal).

Once the token is received, follow the Home Assistant [documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/creating_component_loading.html) to set up this custom component.

The custom component uses the [pyawair package](https://pypi.org/project/pyawair/) that can be found on pypi.

# Warning
This component is still under active development, as is the Awair API and the pyawair package. Please understand that these are all still in beta and functionality might change.
